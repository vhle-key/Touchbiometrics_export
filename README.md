# Touchbiometrics_export
Project Code by Viet Hoang Le, supervisor: Prof. Jiankun Hu. October 2020

Due to different dataset structures and scenarios, 3 classifiers are made - almost 99% similar code
but with some parameters different.

Refer to my project paper, Simply runs each classifier and inputs parameters to verify the experimental results.

Antal_cv_classifier:
    Only asks for train_size and n_bundle and dataset1 or dataset2.
    Also asks for #runs, approx. 15s per run at train_size = 40

Frank_cv_classifier:
    Asks horizontal/vertical, which scenario, train_size and n_bundle
    Asks for #runs, approx.8s per intrasession run (trainsize = 40) or 13s per intersession run (trainsize = 80)


Syed:
    Asks for train_size, n_bundle, stroke orient(horizontal/vertical)-device-posture combinations
    Approx. 20s per run per combination.
